# NLP-Auto-Job-Classification
Use a NLP Machine Learning model to automatically classify a job ad. The model made is then used in a basic Flask web app which is a job advertisment website.
When a new job ad is added to the website, the model generated in the first part of the project is then used to recommend a classification for the new job ad.


The NLP model can be seen in the task1 and task2_3 notebook files and the Flask website vode can be seen in the Flask.py file.

The job ads used and the four different job categories used to train the model and be seen in the data.zip file.
